Accessibility guarranties the interaction of people with disabilities with your site or product. Why you should provide accessible interfaces? Accessibility is one of the main concerns in Liferay, therefore, the design team invests effort on achieving a design system everyone can use. Accessibility brings independance to people with disabilities. It offers the same range of possibilities to users with different physical problems breaking bareers in terms of interaction. Remember that all your users are equally important. Accessibility can be also a legal requierement for your business. Some countries have strict regulations on accessibility and force you to follow standards. These standards and level of accessibility inside them can vary depending on the country.

Empty search The telescope represents the idea of looking for something in the space a nothing has been found. Use this animation for empty search results or empty results on while applying filters over a data set. Successful empty state The spaceship taking off represents a successful state. Use this animation when a list has been emptied that is worthy of celebration. For example, when a notifications list gets emptied. Changing animations Changing animations is possible. This is just the set of animations that Lexicon provides for Liferay products. Your business may have its own needs and this is one of the points where your brand can have an impact by customizing the animations. Our advice is to choose a theme and create a story behind it.

Base Grid The Base Grid is the main metric reference of our system from which the rest of the layout structures are built. It is at the same time the starting point when defining the dimensions, paddings and margins of the elements of the interface. This grid is constructed from a base 8px module, so that both the dimensions of the elements and the distances between them will always be multiples of 8; 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 … In this way we provide a common metric pattern that contributes to create visual coherence and consistency between the different elements of the system and their spatial relationships. The use of this reference grid favors an efficient workflow, reducing the number of design decisions as well as improving communication between designers and developers. Establishing a minimum metric unit that is not too small can help us limit the chances of distorting the visual consistency and taking advantage of its other benefits. However there will always be specific situations in which it is convenient to work with values ​​smaller than 8px. In these cases, the system also provides a downward scaling allowing the use of the 4px unit. Either way, values ​​less than 8 px will be primarily associated with the anatomy of the interface's basic elements rather than the specification of distances between elements and page composition. Making use of the terminology proposed by atomic design, these minimum measures would be used almost exclusively to define the internal anatomy of elements like atoms or molecules. Taking care at all times that the block that forms the element fits the base grid of 8 px. As for example the molecule formed by a label and a text input, or the one formed by a label, an input an a helper text. To know a little more about the grid of 8 px we recommend checking some of the articles that have served as reference and inspiration for us to adopt this pattern. 8pt Grid Intro to The 8-Point Grid System Column System The column system is the main structural pattern when organizing and arranging elements on page horizontally. It is not so much a reference to establish the distances between small elements like the different icons or buttons that can coexist in a toolbar for example. It is more a layout framework oriented to organize and establish divisions between medium and large blocks of content. The Lexicon system is a 12 column structure based on the Bootstrap CSS Grid, where we introduce a change in the value of the gutter to fit our base grid. In this case the gutter would be 24px. A value that we find repeated in other basic structural references of the system. The columns behave in a fluid manner, so that their width will always be a relative value that varies depending on the size of their parent container. The gutter is the only value that remains fixed when the viewport resizes. Vertical Rhythm The grid base of 8 px is also established as baseline in order to set the distances between elements at vertical level. But when defining the vertical spacing between paragraphs of text and elements or groups of elements that somehow configure medium and large size structural blocks is better to have a greater value as a reference. Taking the name from bootstrap variables, we call it “spacer-y”. To set this value, we will refer to the line height of the main system font style; 24px. With this reference we seek to establish a pattern that helps to avoid the dance of measures and favors the consistency in the vertical rhythm. For small viewports, we can make adjustments with the aim of optimizing vertical space but always respecting the base grid. Normally in these cases we use the 16px spacer-y as we do for the gutter between columns and the lateral space of the container. It is understood that this metric pattern does not solve the vertical space needs of all possible cases. Either way it is established as a starting point on which to make timely adjustments when necessary. Containers Lexicon provides two types. A fixed width container and a fluid container with relative width. Fluid container The width of this container is adjusted fluidly according to the size of the viewport. Fixed width container This container is defined by a value of maximum width. This value is adjusted to the sizes of the different viewports according to predefined breakpoints. Breakpoint table In this table you can visualize all the variations of the layout system values according to the different breakpoints. | Breakpoint | Device Size | Container Width | | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | | < 576px | Extra small devices (Portrait phones) | Auto | | &ge; 576px | Small devices (Landscape phones) | Auto | | &ge; 768px | Medium devices (Tablets) | Auto | | &ge; 992px | Large devices (Desktops) | Auto | | &ge; 1280px | Extra large devices (Large desktops) | 1248px | ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/grid.md","id":"grid","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html"},"typography":{"title":"Typography","description":"Typeface usage.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" Description Lexicon does not provide a typography inside the design system. System font is the decision taken. System Font What is a System Font? System Font is the font used by the OS. Each OS has a different one based on their own preferrence. Some examples are: | OS | Version | System Font | | -- | ------- | ----------- | | Mac OS X | El Capitan | San Francisco | | Mac OS X | Yosemite | Helvetica Neue | | Windows | Vista | Segoe UI | | Android | Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0)+ | Roboto | | Ubuntu | All versions | Ubuntu | Some benefits of System Font This decision reinforces the following points: There is no access problem to it. It doesn't depend on CDN. System fonts are thought to work in a wide range of languages. It reduces significantly the amount of css to download. Wider range of font weights is provided without the download cost. The system font is always usually more readable. The system font is more natural as the user is used to it from the OS. Changing system font for other font It is always possible to change the system font by any of your choice. Please when making this change, take into account that not modifying the line height is essential and to play with the font body. You will probably have to look for a rule that allows you to make this quick change. An example is provided with Source Sans Pro: | | System Font | Source Sans Pro | |-|----|----| | Large | 15px | 18px | | Base | 14px | 16px | | Small | 13px | 14px | | Extra Small | 11px | 12px | The base line heigth used in Lexicon is 1.5 for the previous font sizes.

Without the proper messaging for your product’s navigation and functionality, uncertainty creeps into your user’s minds. The messages and naming conventions you use throughout your product complement its design. No matter how well-constructed your design, poor messaging can doom your product’s effectiveness. Clarity, confidence, and consistency in messaging promotes product reliability. Be Clear Longer messaging is not always more helpful. Be concise; understand your user’s needs in a given situation and provide them with just enough information to be successful. If an interaction is obvious, don’t add messaging. A wordy product is an eyesore. | Case | Example | | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Do: | Initiates the process. | | Don’t: | If you click this button, then you will initiate a process that does something. Doing something is essential for something else. | Be Confident Be bold! Take confidence in what you say! The way you provide information sets the tone for what users expect. Products that exude confidence put users at ease when making difficult decisions. | Case | Example | | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | | Do: | Click this to save your work. | | Don’t: | Clicking this should save your work. | Be Current Use present tense throughout product messaging. Promote the product as being alive; it helps you now, telling you what to do now. If you click a button, it won’t do something later; it accomplishes the task immediately. | Case | Example | | ---------- | ------------------------ | | Do: | Saves the form. | | Don’t: | This will save the form. | Be Consistent Consistency gives users peace of mind. You want people to feel comfortable navigating your product. Surprises and uncertainty make people uncomfortable. Consistent messaging gives users freedom to focus on what they’re doing, and not worry about what the product is trying to tell them. Below are two example techniques you can apply for consistent phrasing: 1. Apply Text Styles Consistently Formulate the styling you want to use in your product and stick to it. For example, you could assign styling standards to messaging types in your product (e.g., headings, instructions, checkboxes, etc.). Title: Capitalize all words (except articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions) and omit any trailing punctuation. Phrase: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns and omit any trailing periods (question marks allowed). Sentence: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns and use normal punctuation. Tone, capitalization, and punctuation should follow a similar style on any given interface. | Case | Example | | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Do: | | | Don’t: | | 2. Address Your Users the Same Way For example, don’t refer to them as we, the user, and you in the same context. | Case | Example | | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Do: | Click the button to continue. You can select the other button at any time. | | Don’t: | Click the button so we can continue. The user can select the other button at any time. | Remember, your writing style sets the tone for your product. Show people you care by guiding them with sensible, consistent messaging.

This way we would have two different configurations: 3+9 columns This is the default configuration used when the content is a table, a list or any other content structure except a form. Responsive behavior On viewport sizes equal or less than 768px we introduce to changes of the layout in order to optimize space for content: The change of the vertical navigation to a toggle top navigation as is described on the Nested navigation. The change of the box from 9 to 12 columns. Metrics Example 3+8 columns (Forms) When the box shown in this type of layout is a box that contains a form, it has to be adapted to the measures established for form containers. Therefore the space to occupy would be 8 instead of 9 columns. Responsive behavior The main point to take into account is the change from 8 to 9 columns on viewport sizes equal or less than 992px in order to optimize space for content. Metrics Example Exceptions 3+9 columns and 3+8 columns are the most common situations to have in Lexicon interfaces, but 2 other exceptional scenarios are possible. Scenario 1: 3+9 columns configuration turns into 2+10 columns configuration. Scenario 2: 3+8 columns configuration turns into 2+9 columns configuration. These two scenarios are only desirable when you are sure that the sidebar width is enough with 2 columns. Reasons to move into these configurations can be: Really short vertical navigation titles. Please make sure this happens in all the languages that your site manages. More space in the main box to fit a table with many columns. Please if you move into these configuration make sure you apply 2 columns for the sidebar in all application sections instead of 2 in some and 3 in others for the sake of consistency in your application.

A guide to design principles, components, patterns and contexts of use that contributes to give consistency and coherence to these products and, ultimately, provide a satisfactory and unified experience to its users. Lexicon is a constantly evolving project. An iterative work that seeks to improve and gradually adapt to the evolution of technology and people. Modular approach The Lexicon approach to interface design is based essentially on modularity. It is configured as a system that from a controlled number of components is able to respond to the multiple and different needs of liferay products. An exercise in synthesis, abstraction and coordination that seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times and, above all, to guarantee the consistency we want for the use experience. For this, the construction of Lexicon is based on the Atomic Design theoretical approach. A work methodology based on modularity that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized logic to the creation of interfaces design systems. This methodology has been ideated and developed by the designer Brad Frost and is based on nonlinear process organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages. Lexicon site Lexicon Site is then presented as the necessary platform for the diffusion and access to Lexicon system by designers, developers or any other person involved in the creation of digital products. Mainly focused on Liferay community, but open to anyone who wants to make use of its content and also want to contribute with their own proposals and suggestions. Lexicon Site tries to collect all patterns created using Lexicon in Liferay products. This doesn't mean that all of them are reflected in Clay. Clay only implements those patterns that are of common use in several of our products and/or applications, providing a maintenance as they are more important not only for us but also for you. In this way, the components are labeled in the following way | Label | Usage | | ---- | ----- | | CLAY | Providing a link to the pattern implementation. | | PORTAL | Informing that the pattern is use in a concrete product or application. | | PENDING | The pattern has been designed and will be implemented either in Clay or a Product/Application. | Implement Lexicon Lexicon is not an implementation, it is just a set of patterns, rules and behaviors.

We will update style changes, already compromised, before leaving beta status. April 20th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better: Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples Forms: re-organized for better understanding Animations: pending to include the real animation. But a first introduction is there as reference. Labels: patterns have labelled to know if they are implemented by Clay or they are owned by any other team/application. Status table: to know in what status the design and implementation is. January 17th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better: Do's and Don'ts have been included for several patterns as: badges, labels, table, actions definition and popover. This provides us with a more graphic way of defining examples. Multiple step form now includes an example to understand how the pattern is build in an use case. Text input localizable has been released. Card layout has been added inside layouts at Design Principles. Vertical navigation has been updated with an example of collapsible menu in mobile. Sidebar documentation has been splitted in several pages for a better documentation purpose focusing on special needs. January 8th, 2018 Examples Examples of use have been added into table to make more clear the row hover action with images on what can be done or not. Moreover, multistep form has been updated with a layout example in a form to better understand how it must be applied. Last but not least, checkbox groups and radio groups examples with metrix have been offered. January 3rd, 2018 Sites A full set of components inside sites section is already available to build you own site widgets. This will allow you to transform old widgets into new ones towards looking for a better information architecture, structure, and refreshing design. November 28th, 2017 Layouts and Form Hierarchy As part of the improvement in Lexicon we want to clearly defined the different layout possibilities the we usually find in admin pages. Layout is part of our design principles as it belong to a series of principles to start builing interfaces with our system. Forms are now better definied as the hierarchy is expressed in a dedicated page. Slider has been defined also inside Forms section. November 20th, 2017 Charts and Sites Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage. Charts is a totally new pattern in Lexicon and with it we want to provide you a full set of principles related to it to improve accessibility, preception and interpretation. Sites tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in upcoming dates in this area towards next portal release. November 13th, 2017 Updates Liferay is happy to announce a new version of Lexicon in alpha state.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
