Accessibility guarranties the interaction of people with disabilities with your site or product. Why you should provide accessible interfaces? Accessibility is one of the main concerns in Liferay, therefore, the design team invests effort on achieving a design system everyone can use. Accessibility brings independance to people with disabilities. It offers the same range of possibilities to users with different physical problems breaking bareers in terms of interaction. Remember that all your users are equally important. Accessibility can be also a legal requierement for your business. Some countries have strict regulations on accessibility and force you to follow standards. These standards and level of accessibility inside them can vary depending on the country. Some of these standards are: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from W3C Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/guidelines/accessibility.md","id":"accessibility","location":"/docs/guidelines/accessibility.html","url":"/docs/guidelines/accessibility.html"},"typography":{"title":"Typography","description":"Typeface usage.","layout":"guide","weight":2,"content":" Primary Typeface: Source Sans Pro There are a number of qualities that make Source Sans Pro the obvious choice for Liferay: Support for over 21 languages (including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean)&mdash;critical for helping us stay consistent in our offices all over the world.

A guide to design principles, components, patterns and contexts of use that contributes to give consistency and coherence to these products and, ultimately, provide a satisfactory and unified experience to its users. Lexicon is a constantly evolving project. An iterative work that seeks to improve and gradually adapt to the evolution of technology and people. Modular approach The Lexicon approach to interface design is based essentially on modularity. It is configured as a system that from a controlled number of components is able to respond to the multiple and different needs of liferay products. An exercise in synthesis, abstraction and coordination that seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times and, above all, to guarantee the consistency we want for the use experience. For this, the construction of Lexicon is based on the Atomic Design theoretical approach. A work methodology based on modularity that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized logic to the creation of interfaces design systems. This methodology has been ideated and developed by the designer Brad Frost and is based on nonlinear process organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages.
